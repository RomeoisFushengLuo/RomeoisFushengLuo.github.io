I am currently a Y4 student at the University of Nottingham, Ningbo China [UNNC](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/index.aspx). I am studying mathematics and applied mathematics as my major from the year 2021 until now. Before that, I am a Business and Economics student. You can consider me as knowing a lot of things in economics and finance since I have spent 2 years in that. 

My academic performance is excellent, obtained an average of 85 in Y2 studying, 80 in Y3 studying and 89 in Y4 studying with one scholarship award and one excellent graduate in Zhejiang Province award. And I am expected to graduate from UNNC at the degree of first honor under the British educational system. Besides, I consider myself with solid fundamental skills in mathematics analysis. This could help me do whatever I want in the applied mathematics area.

My current interest lies in Data Science, and Machine learning (AI related). In particular, in the applied mathematics areas, like finance, physics and biology. For further study, I am planing to read a PhD as my first priority, or searching for career opportunities in the industry.
